# Plan for "Generate Report"

A multi-step process for generating report by analyzing code relationships and dependencies.

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

**Step 1: Code Annotation**

- Generate annotations for each file in the codebase
- Output: Annotated Files + their Annotations

**Step 2: File Summarization**

- Create summaries for each file based on its annotations
- Output: File Summaries derived from annotations

**Step 3: Dependency Relationship Analysis**

- For each dependency relationship in the graph (A -> B) then (B -> C) etc., analyze the annotations of both files
- Generate short summaries describing how the files relate to each other
- Output: Descriptions of all file relationships (including transitive ones)

**Step 4: Feature Report Generation**

- Generate a comprehensive report about the feature being tested
- Use all previous outputs: Annotated Files, Annotations, Summaries, and Relationship Descriptions
- Maybe use agent?

## Overall Purpose:

This appears to be a systematic approach to **understand a codebase deeply before generating report** by:

1. Understanding what each file does (annotations + summaries)
2. Understanding how files interact with each other (dependency analysis)
3. Synthesizing this understanding into a comprehensive feature report
4. Presumably using this deep understanding to generate meaningful tests
